# 3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly
# rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a
# rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and
# float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types
# numbers properly.

hours = float(input("Digite o nÃºmero de horas:"))
rate = float(input("Digite o valor da hora:"))

if hours > 40:
    calc = ((hours - 40) * 1.5 + 40) * rate
else:
    calc = hours * rate

print(calc)
